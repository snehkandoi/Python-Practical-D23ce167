# Exercise :: Level 1

# 1. Create an empty tuple
empty_tuple = ()
print("Empty Tuple ::",empty_tuple)

# 2. Create a tuple containing names of your sisters and your brothers (imaginary siblings are fine)
empty_tuple = ("Megha","Jiya","Pusti","Sneh","Pratik","Keyur")
print("Tuple ::",empty_tuple)

# 3. Join brothers and sisters tuples and assign it to siblings
brother=("Sneh", "Keyur","Pratik","Keyur")
sister=("Megha","Jiya","Pusti")
siblings=", ".join(brother+sister)
print("Joining Sibling and Printing Tuple ::",siblings)

# 4. How many siblings do you have?
count=list(siblings.split(","))
print("We Are ::",len(count)," Siblings")

# 5. Modify the siblings tuple and add the name of your father and mother and assign it to family_members
parent=("Jitendra","Yogini ben")
family_members=(siblings,parent)
print("Adding All Together ::",family_members)

# Exercises: Level 2

#1. Unpack siblings and parents from family_members
print("\nExercise 2\n")

(siblings),(parent)=family_members
print("Parents ::",parent)
print("Siblings ::",siblings)

# 2. Create fruits, vegetables and animal products tuples. Join the three tuples and assign it to a variable called food_stuff_tp.
fruits = ("Apple","Grapes","Banana")
vegetable = ("Carrot","Potato","Tomato")
animal = ("Horse","Tiger","Dog")
foof_stuff_tp = fruits + vegetable + animal
print("Merging 3 Tuple and Assigning ::",foof_stuff_tp)

# 3. Change the about food_stuff_tp  tuple to a food_stuff_lt list
foof_stuff_lt = list(foof_stuff_tp)
print("Changing Name ::",foof_stuff_lt)

# 4. Slice out the middle item or items from the food_stuff_tp tuple or food_stuff_lt list.
middle = list(foof_stuff_tp)
count = len(middle)//2
print("Middle Element from Tuple ::",middle[count])
print("Middle Element from List ::",foof_stuff_tp[count])

# 5. Slice out the first three items and the last three items from food_staff_lt list
print("First 3 Item ::",foof_stuff_lt[:3])
print("Last 3 Item ::",foof_stuff_lt[-3:])

# 6. Delete the food_staff_tp tuple completely
del foof_stuff_tp

# 7. Check if an item exists in  tuple:
print('demo' in foof_stuff_lt)

nordic_countries = ('Denmark', 'Finland','Iceland', 'Norway', 'Sweden')

# 8. Check if 'Estonia' is a nordic country
print("Is Estonia is a nordic_country ::",'Estonia' in nordic_countries)

# 9. Check if 'Iceland' is a nordic country
print("Is Estonia is a nordic_country ::",'Iceland' in nordic_countries)
